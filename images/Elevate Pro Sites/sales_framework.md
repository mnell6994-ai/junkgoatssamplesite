# PART 1: THE SALES MINDSET

## YOUR MENTAL FRAMEWORK

### You Are NOT:
❌ A web designer trying to sell them something
❌ Begging for their business
❌ Competing on price
❌ Hoping they say yes

### You ARE:
✅ A former business owner offering a solution to their biggest pain
✅ Qualifying if THEY are a good fit for YOU
✅ Solving a real problem (unpredictable lead flow)
✅ Confident because you've done this yourself

### The Core Belief:
**"I know this works because I did it. If they don't want it, that's their loss, not mine."**

### The Reframe:
**You're not selling. You're diagnosing if you can help them.**

---

## THE POWER DYNAMIC

### When They Feel Like They're Selling YOU:

**Signs:**
- They're answering your questions thoroughly
- They're explaining their business
- They're asking about your process
- They're worried YOU might not take them

**You're in control.**

### When YOU Feel Like You're Selling THEM:

**Signs:**
- You're justifying your price
- You're over-explaining
- You're afraid of their objections
- You're desperate for them to say yes

**You've lost control. Reset.**

---

## THE GOLDEN RULE OF SALES

**"Whoever cares less, wins."**

Not "doesn't care at all" - you care about helping them.

But you care MORE about working with the right clients than closing everyone.

**This makes you magnetic.**

---

# PART 2: PRE-CALL PREPARATION

## BEFORE EVERY DISCOVERY CALL

### Research (5-10 minutes):

**Look up:**
1. Their current website (if they have one)
   - Note: Speed, design, mobile experience
   - Does it have quote forms?
   - Is there any SEO effort visible?

2. Their Google Business Profile
   - Current ranking for "[service] [city]"
   - Number of reviews
   - Photos quality
   - Is it optimized?

3. Their competitors
   - Who ranks #1-3 for their keywords?
   - What do their sites look like?
   - What's their opportunity?

4. Their business basics
   - How long in business (LinkedIn, about page)
   - Team size (approximate)
   - Service area

### What This Tells You:

**If they have NO website or terrible website:**
- Bigger opportunity
- More convincing needed (they're skeptical)
- Emphasize "you're leaving money on table"

**If they have DECENT website:**
- They've invested before
- Focus on "let's make it actually work"
- Emphasize ongoing optimization

**If they rank well already:**
- Probably not a fit (unless they want expansion)
- Focus on "maintain + grow" angle

### Your Pre-Call Prep Doc:

Create a simple template for each call:

```
DISCOVERY CALL PREP - [Name] - [Company]

Business: [Type] in [City]
Current Website: [URL or "None"]
Current GBP Ranking: [#X for main keyword]
Reviews: [Count + Rating]
Key Observations:
- 
- 
- 

Opportunity:
- 
- 

Questions to Ask:
-

```

**This makes you look informed and professional.**

# PART 3: THE PERFECT CALL STRUCTURE

## THE 30-MINUTE DISCOVERY CALL FRAMEWORK

### Timeline Breakdown:

**Minutes 1-2:** Opening + Rapport
**Minutes 3-10:** Qualification Questions
**Minutes 11-18:** Presentation (Your Story + Offer)
**Minutes 19-25:** Objection Handling
**Minutes 26-30:** Close or Next Steps

---

## OPENING (Minutes 1-2)

### Goal: Set the frame, build rapport, establish authority

### Script Option A: The Casual Open

**YOU:**
"Hey [Name], it's [Your Name] from Elevate Pro Sites. How's your day going?"

**THEM:**
"Good, busy, you know how it is."

**YOU:**
"I bet. I remember those days running my junk removal business—never enough hours. 

So, you filled out the form on my site about getting a better web presence. Before I dive into what I do, I want to make sure we're even a good fit. Sound fair?"

**[They say yes]**

"Cool. Let me ask you a few questions about your business, and then I'll share what I do and we'll see if it makes sense. That work?"

---

### Script Option B: The Direct Open

**YOU:**
"Hey [Name], thanks for hopping on. I'm [Your Name]. 

Quick context: I used to run a junk removal business here in Richmond. Built it up, ranked #1 on Google, sold it in 2024. My competitor STILL uses the same website I built because it generates leads every single day.

Now I do the same thing for other home service businesses. That's why you're here, right? You want more consistent leads without going broke on HomeAdvisor?"

**THEM:**
"Yeah, exactly."

**YOU:**
"Perfect. Let me ask you some questions so I understand what you need, then I'll walk you through what I do. Cool?"

---

### Script Option C: The Story Open (Most Powerful)

**YOU:**
"Hey [Name], [Your Name] here. Good to meet you.

Quick story before we dive in: In 2020, I was in your shoes. I had a junk removal business and I was BLEEDING money on lead services. HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack, all of them. Spending $2,000 a month and half the leads were garbage.

So I figured out how to generate my own leads through Google. Built a system that worked so well, when I sold the business last year, my competitor kept my exact website for 18 months. Hasn't changed a thing.

That's what I help contractors do now—stop renting leads and own their pipeline.

Make sense why you're here?"

**THEM:**
"Yeah, that's exactly what I need."

**YOU:**
"Cool. Let me ask you a few questions and see if I can help."

---

### Which Opening to Use?

**Use Option A (Casual):** If they seem relaxed, younger, easy-going
**Use Option B (Direct):** If they seem busy, no-nonsense, older
**Use Option C (Story):** If they seem skeptical or burned before

**All accomplish the same thing: Frame the call as YOU qualifying THEM.**

---

## QUALIFICATION QUESTIONS (Minutes 3-10)

### Goal: Understand their situation, pain, and readiness to invest

### The Question Framework (Ask in This Order):

---

### QUESTION 1: The Business Basics

**YOU:**
"So tell me about your business. How long have you been [roofing/plumbing/etc]?"

**What You're Listening For:**
- Are they established (2+ years) or brand new?
- Do they sound stable or struggling?
- Quality of work (do they mention certifications, pride?)

**Red Flag:** "I just started 6 months ago"
→ Too new, not a fit (they need leads first, branding later)

**Green Flag:** "Been doing this 8 years, started on my own 3 years ago"
→ Established, ready to scale

---

### QUESTION 2: The Lead Source Question (CRITICAL)

**YOU:**
"Where are most of your jobs coming from right now?"

**What You're Listening For:**
- Referrals only = good work but no marketing
- HomeAdvisor/Thumbtack = paying for leads, ready to own
- Old website = understands value, just needs better execution
- Yard signs/truck = old school, might need education

**Follow-Up Based on Answer:**

**If they say "Mostly referrals":**
**YOU:** "That's great—means you do quality work. But you're probably dealing with feast or famine, right? Some months are slammed, others are slow?"

**If they say "HomeAdvisor" or similar:**
**YOU:** "How's that working for you? Be honest." [Let them vent]
**YOU:** "Yeah, I hear that a lot. What are you spending per month on that?"
[They tell you]
**YOU:** "And the quality of those leads?"
[They'll complain]
**YOU:** "Right. So you're spending [$X/month] for leads you're competing for with 3 other guys. What if you spent about the same but OWNED the leads instead?"

**If they say "I have a website but it doesn't do much":**
**YOU:** "Got it. When's the last time you updated it or did any SEO?"
[They probably don't know]
**YOU:** "That's the problem. A website sitting there doing nothing is just an online brochure. You need it actively generating leads. That's what I do."

---

### QUESTION 3: The Website Question

**YOU:**
"Do you have a website now?"

**If YES:**
**YOU:** "Cool, what's the URL?"
[Pull it up while talking]
**YOU:** "Okay, I'm looking at it now. When's the last time someone made changes to it?"

**What You're Listening For:**
- If they say "2018" or "I don't know" = abandoned, easy win
- If they say "My nephew built it" = low quality, easy upgrade
- If they say "I paid $5K two years ago" = invested before, will invest again

**If NO:**
**YOU:** "Interesting. So right now if someone Googles '[his service] [his city]', they're not finding you?"
**THEM:** "I guess not."
**YOU:** "And you're okay with that?" [Pointed question]
**THEM:** "Well, no..."
**YOU:** "Right. So every day someone's searching for what you do, and they're hiring your competitor instead. How much revenue do you think that costs you per month?"

---

### QUESTION 4: The Google Rankings Question

**YOU:**
"If I Google '[plumber] [your city]' right now, where do you show up?"

**What You're Listening For:**
- "I don't know" = Not tracking, opportunity
- "I'm on page 3" = Knows they need help
- "I'm #1" = Probably not a fit (already winning)

**Follow-Up:**
**YOU:** "Do you know who IS ranking #1?"
[They might know their competitor]
**YOU:** "Right. So they're getting all the calls while you're waiting for referrals. That's exactly what I fix."

---

### QUESTION 5: The Revenue Question (Qualify They Can Afford You)

**YOU:**
"Just to make sure we're in the right ballpark—roughly what's your annual revenue? Ballpark is fine."

**What You're Listening For:**
- **Under $200K:** Probably too small (can't afford ongoing investment)
- **$200K-$500K:** Perfect (ready to scale)
- **$500K-$2M:** Perfect (established, can definitely afford)
- **$2M+:** Might need bigger agency (or could be great client)

**If they hesitate:**
**YOU:** "The reason I ask is I want to make sure my service makes sense for your business size. I work best with established guys doing at least $300-400K who are ready to scale. Does that sound like you?"

**Red Flag:** If under $200K, you can still help but they might struggle with investment

---

### QUESTION 6: The Pain Question (MOST IMPORTANT)

**YOU:**
"So what made you reach out now? Like, what's the trigger? You've been running your business [X] years—why now?"

**What You're Listening For:**
- "Slow season coming up" = Fear-driven (good motivator)
- "Tired of HomeAdvisor" = Pain-driven (great motivator)
- "Want to grow" = Ambition-driven (good if backed by pain)
- "My buddy said I should" = Low urgency (harder close)

**Follow-Up:**
**YOU:** "Got it. And if we're talking 6 months from now and nothing's changed—you're still dealing with [their pain]—how would that feel?"

**[Let them sit with that]**

This makes the pain real and urgent.

---

### QUESTION 7: The Timeline Question

**YOU:**
"If this is a fit, how soon are you looking to get started?"

**What You're Listening For:**
- "ASAP" = High urgency, ready to buy
- "Next month or two" = Medium urgency
- "Just exploring" = Low urgency, probably tire kicker

**If they say "just exploring":**
**YOU:** "I appreciate the honesty. Here's the thing—I only have bandwidth for [X] clients right now, and I'm looking for people who are ready to move. If you're just kicking tires, I'm probably not the right fit. But if you're serious about fixing this in the next 30 days, let's talk. Which is it?"

**This weeds out tire kickers FAST.**

---

### QUESTION 8: The Budget Question (Ask Delicately)

**YOU:**
"Last question before I explain what I do: Have you budgeted anything for marketing this year?"

**What You're Listening For:**
- "Yeah, I spend $X on HomeAdvisor" = Has budget, will reallocate
- "Not really" = Might balk at price
- "I spent $5K on a website two years ago" = Has invested before

**If they say "not really":**
**YOU:** "Okay, so if I told you this would cost about $500 a month, is that something you could swing if it meant consistent leads?"

**[Gauge their reaction]**

**If they flinch:** Probably not a fit.
**If they say "yeah, if it works":** Good to go.

---

## TRANSITION TO PRESENTATION

**YOU:**
"Cool. Okay, I have a good picture of where you're at. Let me share what I do and we'll see if it makes sense. Sound good?"

**[They say yes]**

---

# PART 4: THE PRESENTATION (Minutes 11-18)

## YOUR PITCH STRUCTURE

### The Framework: **Problem → Agitate → Solution → Proof → Offer**

---

### STEP 1: Restate Their Problem

**YOU:**
"So here's what I'm hearing: You're doing great work, customers love you, but your lead flow is all over the place. Some months you're slammed, other months you're worried about payroll. And you're either relying on expensive lead services like HomeAdvisor, or you're 100% dependent on referrals. Either way, you don't control your pipeline. Sound about right?"

**[They agree]**

---

### STEP 2: Agitate the Pain

**YOU:**
"And here's the thing—that's not going to change on its own. In fact, it's probably getting worse. More competitors are getting online. Lead services are getting more expensive. And if you're relying on referrals, one bad review or one slow season can really hurt.

Plus, every single day, someone in [their city] is Googling '[their service] near me', and they're calling whoever shows up first. Right now, that's not you. That's revenue walking out the door every single day."

**[Pause. Let that sink in.]**

---

### STEP 3: Present the Solution (Your Story)

**YOU:**
"So here's what I do, and why I'm confident it works:

In 2020, I was in your exact shoes. I had a junk removal business and I was bleeding $2,000 a month on HomeAdvisor and Thumbtack. The leads sucked. I was competing with 4 other guys for every job. And I was barely profitable.

So I said screw it, I'm figuring this out myself.

I built a website, learned SEO, optimized my Google Business Profile, and got myself ranking #1 for 'junk removal Richmond VA.'

And it WORKED. Within 90 days, I had consistent leads coming in every single day. I stopped paying for leads completely. My phone rang with qualified customers who found ME, not 3 other competitors.

I grew that business to the point where I sold it in January 2024.

And here's the crazy part: My competitor—the guy who bought my business—he kept my website EXACTLY as I built it. For 18 months. Hasn't changed a single thing.

Why? Because it still generates leads every single day. He couldn't improve it because I built it right the first time.

I still get notifications when someone fills out a quote request on that site. Daily.

So now, I do the same thing for other home service businesses. I build them a custom website, optimize it for Google, handle all the ongoing SEO, and get them showing up when locals search for their services.

That's it. That's what I do."

**[Pause. Let them process.]**

---

### STEP 4: The Offer Details

**YOU:**
"Here's how it works specifically for you:

**Phase 1: We Build Your Site (14 Days)**

We jump on a 30-minute strategy call—just like this one. You send me your logo and some photos of your work. That's it.

I write all the copy for you. I design the site around YOUR brand—not some template that looks like every other [plumber/roofer/etc].

I build in strategic quote forms, clear calls-to-action, mobile optimization—everything designed to convert visitors into customers, not just look pretty.

14 days later, your site is live.

**Phase 2: We Optimize Every Week (Ongoing)**

This is where most web designers fail. They build you a site and disappear.

I don't do that.

Every single week, I'm working on your SEO:
- Researching keywords in your area
- Optimizing your pages to rank higher
- Building up your Google Business Profile
- Monitoring your rankings and traffic

And every week, you get a report from me showing:
- Where you're ranking for key searches
- How much traffic you're getting
- What I did that week
- What we're focusing on next

So you're never in the dark wondering 'is this working?'

**Phase 3: Unlimited Changes**

Need to add a new service? Update your pricing? Change your phone number? Swap out photos?

Just message me. I handle it. No extra fees. No 'sorry, that'll be $200.'

Unlimited changes. Included.

**Phase 4: Your Bonus (Founding Clients Only)**

Since you're one of my first 10 clients, I'm also throwing in complete Google Business Profile optimization. Normally I charge separately for that, but for founding clients, it's included.

This is the thing that gets you showing up in the map pack when people search '[your service] near me.' It's honestly the most valuable part of what I do."

**[Pause]**

---

### STEP 5: The Investment

**YOU:**
"So here's what this costs:

Most web designers charge $3,000 to $8,000 upfront just to build the site. Then if you want ongoing SEO, that's another $500 to $2,000 per month separate. And if you want changes? That's $150 to $300 every single time.

Total first year with a traditional agency: $10,000 to $30,000.

I don't do that.

I do one simple monthly fee: **$497 a month.**

That's it. Everything I just described—custom website, weekly SEO, weekly reports, unlimited changes, Google Business Profile optimization—all included.

And it's month-to-month. No long-term contract. If you're not happy, cancel anytime. No hard feelings.

But here's the catch: I'm only taking 10 founding clients at this rate. After that, the price goes to $897 a month and the Google Business Profile bonus goes away.

Right now I've filled [X] spots. So there are [Y] left.

Make sense?"

**[Pause. Let them think.]**

---

### STEP 6: The Comparison (Paint the Picture)

**YOU:**
"Think about it this way:

You're probably spending $1,000 to $2,000 a month on HomeAdvisor right now, right? And what are you getting? Leads you're competing for with 3 other guys. Price shoppers. People who aren't even serious.

For HALF that, you could have your own website generating YOUR leads. People who found YOU specifically. No competition. Higher quality. And you OWN it—it's your asset.

If we can get you just 2-3 extra jobs per month from your website, this pays for itself 5x over. Agree?"

**[They'll agree]**

---

## TRANSITION TO CLOSE

**YOU:**
"So look—I'm not going to pressure you. I only want to work with people who are serious about fixing this.

Based on what you've told me—[restate their pain]—I think I can help you. 

The question is: Are you ready to stop renting leads and actually own your pipeline?"

**[Pause. Wait for their response.]**

---

# PART 5: OBJECTION HANDLING

## EVERY OBJECTION + YOUR RESPONSE

### The Objection Framework:

1. **Acknowledge** - Show you heard them
2. **Relate** - Show you understand
3. **Reframe** - Change their perspective
4. **Close** - Ask for the sale again

---

### OBJECTION 1: "I need to think about it"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"Totally fair. This is a real investment."

**RELATE:**
"I get it—you don't know me yet. We just met 30 minutes ago."

**REFRAME:**
"Let me ask you this: What specifically do you need to think about? Is it the price, the timeline, whether this will actually work, or something else?"

**[They'll tell you the real objection. Handle that one.]**

**ALTERNATIVE REFRAME:**
"Here's the thing—you've been dealing with [their pain] for how long now? [They answer] Right. So thinking about it for another month just means another month of the same problem. 

The only question is: Do you believe I can help you or not?"

**CLOSE:**
"Look, you're one of [Y] spots left. If you want to think on it for a day or two, I respect that. But I need to know you're serious. Can you commit to giving me an answer by [specific date]?"

---

### OBJECTION 2: "That's too expensive" / "I can't afford that"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"I hear you. $497 a month isn't nothing."

**RELATE:**
"When I was running my business, I was price-sensitive too. Every dollar mattered."

**REFRAME:**
"But here's what I learned: Expensive is when you pay for something and it doesn't work. This isn't expensive if it generates 5-10 extra jobs per month. Then it's the best investment you've made.

Let me ask you this: What's the average job worth to you? [$500? $2,000? $5,000?]

So if this gets you even ONE extra job per month, it pays for itself, right?

And you said you're spending [$X] on HomeAdvisor right now. So we're not even talking about NEW money—we're talking about taking money you're already wasting and putting it toward something you OWN."

**ALTERNATIVE REFRAME (If they truly can't afford it):**
"Let me ask you straight up: Is this 'I don't see the value' or is this 'I literally don't have $500 in the budget'?

[If they say literally don't have it:]

Got it. Look, if you can't swing $500 a month for marketing, you've got bigger problems than a website. You need to focus on cash flow first. Come back to me in 6 months when you're in a better spot."

**[This actually builds respect. Don't chase broke clients.]**

**CLOSE:**
"So if we can get you 2-3 extra jobs per month, you're profitable on this, right? Then let's do it."

---

### OBJECTION 3: "I need to talk to my wife/partner"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"Absolutely. Smart to be on the same page."

**RELATE:**
"I did the same thing when I made big decisions in my business."

**REFRAME:**
"Let me ask: Is your wife/partner involved in the business day-to-day, or is this more about the financial decision?"

**[If financial decision:]**

"Okay. So what's the conversation going to sound like? Are you going to tell her 'This guy wants to charge me $500 a month for a website,' or are you going to tell her 'I found a way to stop wasting money on HomeAdvisor and actually own our lead generation'?

Because those are two very different conversations."

**REFRAME 2:**
"Here's what I've learned: When someone says they need to talk to their spouse, it usually means THEY'RE not sold yet. So let me ask you directly: If your wife said yes right now, would YOU be ready to move forward?"

**[If they hesitate, there's another objection. Dig it out.]**

**CLOSE:**
"Tell you what—why don't you conference her in right now? I'm happy to answer any questions she has. That way you guys can decide together."

**OR**

"Cool. When are you two going to talk about it? Tonight? Tomorrow? Let's schedule a quick 15-minute follow-up call after that conversation so I can answer any questions she has. Does [specific time] work?"

---

### OBJECTION 4: "I've been burned by web designers before"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"I'm not surprised. There are a lot of bad designers out there."

**RELATE:**
"I actually hear this a lot. Let me guess: You paid upfront, they disappeared after launch, and when you needed changes, they either ghosted you or wanted $200 per change?"

**[They'll nod]**

**REFRAME:**
"That's exactly why I do it differently.

First: Month-to-month. No contract. If I suck, fire me. I only stay if I'm earning your business every month.

Second: Unlimited changes included. You'll never get a '$200 for a phone number change' email from me.

Third: Weekly reports. You'll know exactly what I'm doing. Full transparency.

And fourth: I actually ran a business like yours. I'm not some 22-year-old designer who's never signed the front of a paycheck. I've lived your pain.

So the question is: Are you going to let one bad experience keep you from fixing this? Or are you ready to work with someone who actually gets it?"

**CLOSE:**
"Look, I get the hesitation. But the worst case scenario is you're out $497. That's one bad HomeAdvisor lead. The BEST case scenario is this changes your business. Worth the risk?"

---

### OBJECTION 5: "How do I know this will actually work?"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"Fair question. You don't know me yet."

**RELATE:**
"I wouldn't invest $500/month in something without proof either."

**REFRAME + PROOF:**
"So here's my proof:

One: I did this for my own business. I had skin in the game. It worked well enough that I sold that business and my competitor STILL uses my system 18 months later.

Two: I'm so confident this works that I'm doing month-to-month. If it doesn't work, you can cancel. I'm betting on myself here.

Three: I'm not promising instant results. I'm telling you it takes 60-90 days to see real traction with SEO. Anyone who promises you #1 rankings in 30 days is lying.

But here's what I AM promising: I'll do the work every single week. You'll see it in your reports. And within 90 days, you'll be ranking better and getting more traffic than you are today.

The question isn't whether SEO works—it does. The question is: Do you trust me to execute it?"

**CLOSE:**
"So let's do this: Give me 90 days. If after 90 days you're not seeing improvement in your rankings and traffic, tell me and we'll part ways. No hard feelings. But I'm betting you'll be happy. Deal?"

---

### OBJECTION 6: "I already have a website"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"Cool. What's the URL?"

**[Pull it up]**

**RELATE:**
"Yeah, I see it. It's not bad. When's the last time someone updated it?"

**[They probably don't know or say "years ago"]**

**REFRAME:**
"So here's the problem: A website sitting there doing nothing is just a digital billboard on a side road nobody drives down.

You've got a site, but is it ranking? Is it generating leads? When's the last time someone filled out a form on it?"

**[They'll admit it doesn't generate much]**

"Right. Because a website alone doesn't do anything. You need ongoing SEO, optimization, fresh content, technical improvements—all the stuff that gets you actually found on Google.

So the question isn't 'do you have a website'—you clearly do. The question is: Do you have a website that's actively generating leads? And if not, do you want one?"

**CLOSE:**
"I can work with your existing site if you want, or we can start fresh. Either way, the value is in the ongoing optimization. That's what you're really paying for."

---

### OBJECTION 7: "Can I just pay you to build it and I'll handle the rest?"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"I appreciate that. Shows you're hands-on."

**RELATE:**
"I get wanting to save money."

**REFRAME:**
"But here's the thing: The website itself isn't what generates leads. It's the ongoing SEO work.

Think of it like this—the website is the storefront. But if nobody knows the storefront exists, it doesn't matter how nice it looks.

The ongoing optimization is what gets people TO the storefront.

Plus, SEO isn't something you do once. It's something you do every week, every month. Rankings change. Competitors optimize. Google updates. You have to stay on top of it.

So if I just built you a site and walked away, you'd be in the exact same spot 6 months from now—nice site that nobody sees."

**CLOSE:**
"Look, if you want to handle SEO yourself, go for it. But I'm betting within 3 months you'll realize it's way more work than you thought and you'll be back. Why not just do it right the first time?"

---

### OBJECTION 8: "I'm going to get a few more quotes"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"Smart. You should compare."

**RELATE:**
"I did the same thing when I was buying tools for my business."

**REFRAME:**
"Here's what you're going to find:

Option A: Cheap Fiverr guy for $500. You'll get a template site that looks like everyone else's, no ongoing support, and you'll be back here in 6 months.

Option B: Local agency for $5,000 upfront + $1,500/month. You'll get a nice site, but it'll take 3 months, you'll be locked into a contract, and they won't understand your business like I do.

Option C: Try to DIY it on Wix. You'll spend 40 hours, hate your life, and give up.

So yes, shop around. But when you're done, you'll realize I'm the only one offering:
- Zero upfront cost
- Month-to-month
- Someone who's actually run a home service business
- Proven results

I'll be here when you're ready."

**CLOSE:**
"But here's the thing—I've only got [Y] founding spots left at this rate. If you go shop around for 2 weeks and come back, I might be full and you'll be paying $897 instead of $497. Just something to think about."

---

### OBJECTION 9: "I need more time to research"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"Fair enough. What specifically do you want to research?"

**[They'll say something vague]**

**REFRAME:**
"Let me save you some time. Here's what you're going to research:

One: You'll Google 'website designers for contractors' and get overwhelmed with options.

Two: You'll look at my site and my competitor's sites and realize I'm the only one who's actually DONE what I'm teaching.

Three: You'll ask yourself 'is this guy legit?' and you'll see my junk removal site still ranking #1 and realize yes, I am.

Four: You'll come back to the same question: Do you want to fix this or not?

So let's skip the two weeks of research paralysis and just make a decision. You've been dealing with unpredictable leads for how long now? [They answer] Another two weeks of 'research' is just another two weeks of the same problem.

Yes or no: Do you want me to help you?"

**CLOSE:**
"I'm not trying to pressure you, but I am trying to get you to stop overthinking this. You know you need it. I know I can deliver it. Let's do it."

---

### OBJECTION 10: "What if I want to cancel?"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"Good question. Shows you're thinking ahead."

**RELATE:**
"I'd ask the same thing."

**REFRAME:**
"It's month-to-month. 30 days notice and you're out. No cancellation fees. No 'gotcha' clauses.

If you're not happy, tell me and we part ways. Simple as that.

But here's my question: Why are you already thinking about canceling before we've even started?

That tells me you don't trust this will work. So let me ask directly: What would it take for you to feel confident this is going to work?"

**[Dig out the real objection]**

**CLOSE:**
"Look, if after 90 days you're not seeing progress, cancel. But I'm betting you won't want to."

---

### OBJECTION 11: "I don't have time for this right now"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"I get it. You're busy."

**RELATE:**
"I was the same way when I was running jobs every day."

**REFRAME:**
"But here's the beauty of this: It takes almost ZERO time from you.

You give me 30 minutes for the strategy call. You send me your logo and some photos. That's it.

I write the copy. I build the site. I do the SEO. I handle the updates.

Your total time investment after our initial call? 5 minutes per month to read my weekly reports.

That's it.

So the question isn't 'do you have time'—you don't need time. The question is: Are you willing to invest 30 minutes to potentially transform your lead flow?"

**CLOSE:**
"We literally just spent 30 minutes on this call. That's the most time you'll ever need to spend. So let's do it."

---

### OBJECTION 12: "What if it doesn't work in my market?"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"Valid concern. Every market is different."

**RELATE:**
"I've thought about that too."

**REFRAME:**
"But here's the thing: Local SEO works the same everywhere. Whether you're in Frederick, Phoenix, or Portland, the fundamentals are identical:

- Target local keywords
- Optimize your Google Business Profile
- Build local citations
- Get reviews
- Create location-specific content

The strategy is universal. I just apply it to YOUR city instead of mine.

Plus, think about it—if your competitors aren't ranking well, that's an OPPORTUNITY. Easier to rank in a less competitive market than in a saturated one.

So the question isn't 'will it work in my market?' The question is: 'Are your competitors doing SEO?' And if the answer is no, you're about to dominate."

**CLOSE:**
"Let's find out together. 90 days, month-to-month. If it doesn't work, you're out. But I'm betting it does."

---

### OBJECTION 13: "I'm not good with technology"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"Totally understand. Most contractors aren't."

**RELATE:**
"That's exactly why I do this."

**REFRAME:**
"You don't need to be good with technology. That's my job.

You don't touch the website. You don't touch the SEO. You don't touch anything technical.

You just send me photos and tell me what you want changed. I handle the rest.

Think of me like a contractor for your online presence. You wouldn't expect your customers to install their own roof, right? Same thing here. You focus on [roofing/plumbing], I focus on getting you found online."

**CLOSE:**
"So your lack of tech skills is exactly why this works. You outsource it to me. Deal?"

---

### OBJECTION 14: "Can I see examples of your work?"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"Absolutely. Great question."

**SHARE:**
"So the big one is my junk removal business. Let me show you:

[Share screen or send link]

This is the site I built in 2020. My competitor still uses it today. It ranks #1 for 'junk removal Richmond VA.' See that Google Business Profile? 4.9 stars, 200+ reviews. That's what I optimized.

I also just built a couple of example sites to show clients what I can do:

[Show Summit Roofing]
[Show power washing example]

These are samples, not live client sites yet, because I'm just launching this service. But they show you the quality and style you can expect.

The junk removal site is the real proof though—that's a real business still generating real leads."

**CLOSE:**
"Make sense? See the quality?"

---

### OBJECTION 15: "Why should I trust you?"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"You shouldn't. Not yet."

**RELATE:**
"Trust is earned."

**REFRAME:**
"So here's how you evaluate me:

One: I ran a real business. Not some web designer who's never signed a paycheck. I've been in your shoes.

Two: I have proof. My competitor kept my system for 18 months because it works.

Three: I'm offering month-to-month. If I was scamming you, I'd lock you into a 12-month contract. I'm not.

Four: I'm being honest about timelines. I'm telling you SEO takes 60-90 days. I'm not promising instant results like most guys do.

So you don't have to trust me today. But give me 30 days to prove myself. If I don't deliver, fire me. Fair?"

**CLOSE:**
"Look, at some point you're going to have to trust SOMEONE to help you with this. Why not the guy who's actually done it successfully?"

---

# PART 6: CLOSING TECHNIQUES

## HOW TO ASK FOR THE SALE

### The Assumptive Close (Best for Warm Leads)

**YOU:**
"Okay, so it sounds like this makes sense for you. Let me get you set up. What email should I send the onboarding form to?"

**[Start typing before they answer]**

**Why This Works:**
- Assumes the sale
- Low pressure
- Natural transition

---

### The Direct Close (Best for Straightforward People)

**YOU:**
"So look—based on everything we've talked about, I think I can help you. Do you want to move forward?"

**[Shut up and wait]**

**Why This Works:**
- Clear and direct
- No confusion
- Forces a decision

---

### The Alternative Close

**YOU:**
"So we have two options: We can get you in as a founding client at $497/month with the Google Business Profile bonus included, or you can wait and pay $897 later without the bonus.

Which do you want to do?"

**Why This Works:**
- Both options are "yes"
- Creates urgency
- Simple choice

---

### The Scarcity Close

**YOU:**
"Look, I'm only taking 10 founding clients at this rate. I've filled [X] spots already. There are [Y] left.

I can hold one for you until [tomorrow/end of the week], but if you're not serious, I need to offer it to someone else.

So what do you want to do?"

**Why This Works:**
- Creates urgency
- Fear of missing out
- Forces decision

---

### The Takeaway Close (Most Powerful)

**YOU:**
"You know what, let me be honest with you. Based on this conversation, I'm not sure you're ready for this.

It sounds like you're still in research mode and you're not ready to commit to fixing this problem right now.

And that's okay—but I need to focus on people who are serious and ready to move.

So let me ask you straight: Are you ready to do this, or should we just call this a good conversation and move on?"

**[Shut up and wait]**

**Why This Works:**
- Reverses power dynamic
- Triggers loss aversion
- Makes THEM sell YOU
- Only use if they're dragging their feet

**Warning:** This is aggressive. Only use with wishy-washy prospects.

---

### The Summary Close

**YOU:**
"Okay, let me make sure we're on the same page.

You're tired of [their pain—unpredictable leads, HomeAdvisor waste, etc.].

You want to start showing up on Google when people search for [their service].

You want your own website generating YOUR leads, not rented leads you're competing for.

And you want someone who understands home service businesses because they've actually run one.

That's what I'm offering. Custom website, weekly SEO, weekly reports, unlimited changes, Google Business Profile optimization. $497/month, month-to-month.

Does that solve your problem?"

**[They say yes]**

"Great. Let's get you started. What's your email?"

---

### The Puppy Dog Close

**YOU:**
"Here's what I want to do. Let's start with the first 30 days.

I'll build your site, get it live, start the SEO work. You'll get your first few weekly reports and see exactly what I'm doing.

If after 30 days you're not happy with the direction things are going, tell me and we'll part ways. You'll be out $497—the cost of one bad lead from HomeAdvisor.

But if things are looking good—which I'm confident they will be—you keep going and we keep building on it.

Sound fair?"

**Why This Works:**
- Low risk proposition
- "Try before you buy" feel
- Reduces fear

---

# PART 7: FOLLOW-UP FRAMEWORK

## WHEN THEY DON'T COMMIT ON THE CALL

### Immediate Follow-Up (5 Minutes After Call)

**EMAIL SUBJECT:** "Great talking to you, [Name]"

**BODY:**
"Hey [Name],

Really enjoyed our conversation today. I think there's a great opportunity to help you [restate their goal—get consistent leads, stop relying on HomeAdvisor, etc.].

- Custom website built around your brand
- Weekly SEO optimization 
- Weekly reports showing rankings and traffic
- Unlimited changes included
- Google Business Profile optimization (founding client bonus)
- $497/month, month-to-month

As I mentioned, I only have [Y] founding spots left at this rate.

Let me know by [specific date] if you want to move forward, and I'll get you set up.

If you have any other questions, just reply to this email or call me at [phone].

Thanks,
[Your Name]

P.S. - Here's that link to my junk removal site that still ranks #1: [link]"

---

### Day 2 Follow-Up (If No Response)

**TEXT MESSAGE:**

"Hey [Name], [Your Name] here from our call yesterday. Just wanted to make sure you got my email with the recap. Any questions I can answer? - [Your Name]"

**Keep it casual and low-pressure.**

---

### Day 4 Follow-Up (If Still No Response)

**EMAIL SUBJECT:** "Following up - [Y-1] spots left"

**BODY:**
"Hey [Name],

Haven't heard from you since our call on [day]. Just wanted to check in.

I filled another founding client spot yesterday, so there are now [Y-1] spots left at the $497 rate.

After that, the price goes to $897 and you lose the Google Business Profile bonus.

I don't want you to miss out if this is something you're serious about.

If you're still interested, let me know by [date]. If not, no worries—I'll free up the spot for someone else.

Either way, let me know so I can plan accordingly.

Thanks,
[Your Name]"

---

### Day 7 Follow-Up (Final)

**EMAIL SUBJECT:** "Last call - [Name]"

**BODY:**
"Hey [Name],

This is my last follow-up, I promise.

I'm down to [X] founding spots left. If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I'm going to assume you're not interested and I'll move on.

If you DO want to move forward, just reply 'yes' and I'll get you set up immediately.

If not, no hard feelings. Best of luck with your business.

Thanks,
[Your Name]"

**Then STOP. Don't chase anymore.**

---

### The Breakup Email (When They Go Silent)

**Use this if they went silent for 2+ weeks:**

**EMAIL SUBJECT:** "Closing your file"

**BODY:**
"Hey [Name],

I haven't heard from you in a couple weeks, so I'm going to assume you decided to go in a different direction.

No problem at all.

I'm closing your file on my end. If you change your mind down the road, feel free to reach out, but I can't guarantee the founding rate will still be available.

Best of luck with your business.

[Your Name]"

**Why This Works:**
- Often triggers a response ("wait, I was just busy!")
- If they don't respond, they weren't serious anyway
- You look professional, not desperate

**Your version:**
[Practice and write your 60-second version]

---

# PART 11: MINDSET MASTERY

## THE BELIEFS YOU MUST HAVE

### Belief 1: "I provide massive value"

**If you believe $497/month is expensive, they will too.**

**Reframe:** I'm offering $10K+ worth of services for $497. This is a steal.

---

### Belief 2: "I don't need this sale"

**If you're desperate, they smell it.**

**Reframe:** I'm only taking 10 clients. I'm selecting them, not begging them.

---

### Belief 3: "I've done this successfully"

**If you doubt yourself, they will too.**

**Reframe:** I built a business that worked so well my competitor didn't change it for 18 months. I know what I'm doing.

---

### Belief 4: "Not everyone is a fit"

**If you try to close everyone, you'll close no one.**

**Reframe:** I'm looking for serious, established business owners ready to invest. If they're not, that's fine—they're not my client.

---

### Belief 5: "Month-to-month is a feature, not a weakness"

**Some sales guys think contracts = commitment.**

**Reframe:** Month-to-month shows I'm confident in my results. I don't need to trap them—they'll WANT to stay.

---

## THE PRE-CALL RITUAL

**Before every discovery call, do this 5-minute routine:**

1. **Stand up** (Don't sit for calls—energy drops)

2. **Review your proof** (Look at your junk removal site ranking, remind yourself it works)

3. **Read your wins** (Any positive feedback, any closed deal, any testimonial)

4. **Deep breaths** (3 deep breaths, in through nose, out through mouth)

5. **Affirmation** (Out loud: "I know this works. I'm here to help. I'm selecting clients, not begging.")

**Then dial.**

---

## THE POST-CALL RITUAL

**After every call, win or lose:**

1. **Rate the call** (1-10, how did you do?)

2. **Write down one thing you did well**

3. **Write down one thing to improve**

4. **Celebrate wins** (Even small ones—they answered, they asked good questions, they didn't hang up)

5. **Let go of losses** (Not everyone will buy. That's okay.)

**Then move on to the next one.**

---
